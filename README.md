# 2015-VIP-Badge

Congratulations on aquiring a 2015 New Orleans Mini Maker Faire VIP Badge! You have chosen wisely. This badge contains a full blown Arduino, essentially making it a tiny computer than can be programmed to control endless creations limited only by your imagination!

Features:
足 5v power supply! 
足 Breadboard prototyping area!
足 Arduino Uno clone! 
足 Blinky lights!

The assembly instructions can be found here: http://nolamakerfaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/VIPBadgeInstructions.pdf

The code in blink_badge.ino comes preloaded on the included arduino chip. It is a simple sketch which will show you that you have assembled the badge correctly. If everything is working, the LEDs will blink one at a time and turning the trimpot will change the delay between the LEDs turning on and off.

Assemble and conquer!
